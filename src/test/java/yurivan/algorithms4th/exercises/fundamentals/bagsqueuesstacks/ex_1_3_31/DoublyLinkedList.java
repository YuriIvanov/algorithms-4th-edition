    Implement a nested class DoubleNode for building doubly-linked lists, where

    list (null if there is no such item). Then implement static methods for the following
    tasks: insert at the beginning, insert at the end, remove from the beginning, remove
    from the end, insert before a given node, insert after a given node, and remove a given
    node.

/*
    Implement a class that supports the following API:

        public class GeneralizedQueue<Item>
            GeneralizedQueue()  create an empty queue
            boolean isEmpty()   is the queue empty?
            void insert(Item x) add an item
            Item delete(int k)  delete and return the kth least recently inserted item

    First, develop an implementation that uses an array implementation, and then develop
    one that uses a linked-list implementation.
    Note: the algorithms and data structures that we introduce in Chapter 3 make it possible to develop
    an implementation that can guarantee that both insert() and delete() take time proportional to the logarithm
    of the number of items in the queueâ€”see Exercise 3.5.27.

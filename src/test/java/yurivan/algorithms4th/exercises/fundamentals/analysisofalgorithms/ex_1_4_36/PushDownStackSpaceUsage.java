    Justify the entries in the table below, which shows typical space usage for various pushdown stack implementations.
    Use a static nested class for linked-list nodes to avoid the non-static nested class overhead.

    Space  usage in pushdown stacks (various implementations):

    data structure  item type  space usage for N int values (bytes)
    linked list     int        ~32 N
                    Integer    ~64 N

    resizing array  int        between ~4N and ~16N
                    Integer    between ~32N and ~56N

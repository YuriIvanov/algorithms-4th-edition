    Run experiments to evaluate the following implementation of the inner loop of ThreeSum:
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
            for (int k = 0; k < N; k++)
               if (i < j && j < k)
                  if (a[i] + a[j] + a[k] == 0)
                     cnt++;

    Do so by developing a version of DoublingTest that computes the ratio of the running times
    of this program and ThreeSum.

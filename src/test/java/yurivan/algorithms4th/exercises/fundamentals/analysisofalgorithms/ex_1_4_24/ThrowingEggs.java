    Suppose that you have an N-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg is broken if it is
    thrown off floor F or higher, and unhurt otherwise. First, devise a strategy to determine the value of F such
    that the number of broken eggs is ~lg N when using ~lg N throws, then Ô¨Ånd a way to reduce the cost to ~2lg F.

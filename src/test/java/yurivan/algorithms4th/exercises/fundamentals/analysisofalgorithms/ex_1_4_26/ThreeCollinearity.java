    Suppose that you have an algorithm that takes as input N distinct points in the plane and can return
    the number of triples that fall on the same line. Show that you can use this algorithm to solve the 3-sum problem.

    Strong hint: Use algebra to show that (a, a pow 3), (b, b pow 3),  and (c, c pow 3) are collinear
    if and only if a + b + c = 0.

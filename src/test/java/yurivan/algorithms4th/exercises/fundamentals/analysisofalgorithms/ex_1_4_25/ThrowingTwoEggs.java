    Consider the previous question, but now suppose you only have two eggs, and your cost model is the number of throws.
    Devise a strategy to determine F such that the number of throws is at most 2√N, then find a way to reduce the cost
    to ~c √F. This is analogous to a situation where search hits (egg intact) are much cheaper than misses (egg broken).

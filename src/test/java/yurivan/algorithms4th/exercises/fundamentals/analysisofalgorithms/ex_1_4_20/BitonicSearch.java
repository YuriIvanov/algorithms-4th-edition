    An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately
    by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array of N distinct int values,
    determines whether a given integer is in the array. Your program should use ~3lg N compares in the worst case.

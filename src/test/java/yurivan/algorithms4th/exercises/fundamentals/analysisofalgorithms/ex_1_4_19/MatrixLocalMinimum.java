/*
    Given an N-by-N array a[] of N 2 distinct integers, design an algorithm that runs in time proportional to N
    to find a local minimum: a pair of indices i and j such that a[i][j] < a[i + 1][j], a[i][j] < a[i][j + 1],
    a[i][j] < a[i - 1][j], and a[i][j] < a[i][j - 1].
    The running time of your program should be proportional to N in the worst case.

    Histogram.  Suppose that the standard input stream is a sequence of double
    values. Write a program that takes an integer N and two double values l and r from the
    command line and uses StdDraw to plot a histogram of the count of the numbers in the
    standard input stream that fall in each of the N intervals defined by dividing (l , r) into
    N equal-sized intervals.

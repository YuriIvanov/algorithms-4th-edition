    Run computational experiments to check that our shuffling code on page 32 works as advertised.
    Write a program ShuffleTest that takes command-line arguments M and N, does N shuffles of an array of size M
    that is initialized with a[i] = i before each shuffle, and prints an M-by-M table such that row i
    gives the number of times i wound up in position j for all j. All entries in the array should be close to N/M.

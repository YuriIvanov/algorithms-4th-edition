/*
    Write a code fragment that puts the binary representation of a positive integer N into a String s.
    Java has a built-in method Integer.toBinaryString(N) for this job, but the point of the exercise
    is to see how such a method might be implemented. Here is a particularly concise solution:

    String s = "";
    for (int n = N; n > 0; n /= 2)
       s = (n % 2) + s;

    Write a static method histogram() that takes an array a[] of int values and
    an integer M as arguments and returns an array of length M whose ith entry is the
    number of times the integer i appeared in the argument array. If the values in a[] are all
    between 0 and M–1, the sum of the values in the returned array should be equal to a.length.

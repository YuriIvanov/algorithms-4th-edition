    Write a program that reads in lines from standard input with each line containing
    a name and two integers and then uses printf() to print a table with a column of
    the names, the integers, and the result of dividing the first by the second, accurate to
    three decimal places. You could use a program like this to tabulate batting averages for
    baseball players or grades for students.

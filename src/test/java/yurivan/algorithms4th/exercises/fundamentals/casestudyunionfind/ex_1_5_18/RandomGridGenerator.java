/*
    Write a program RandomGrid that takes an int value N from the command line, generates all the connections
    in an N-by-N grid, puts them in random order, randomly orients them (so that p q and q p are equally likely to occur),
    and prints the result to standard output. To randomly order the connections,
    use a RandomBag (see Exercise 1.3.34 on page 167). To encapsulate p and q in a single object,
    use the Connection nested class shown below. Package your program as two static methods:
    generate(), which takes N as argument and returns an array of connections, and main(), which takes N
    from the command line, calls generate(), and iterates through the returned array to print the connections.

    private class Connection
    {
       int p;
       int q;
       public Connection(int p, int q)
       {  this.p = p; this.q = q;  }
    }

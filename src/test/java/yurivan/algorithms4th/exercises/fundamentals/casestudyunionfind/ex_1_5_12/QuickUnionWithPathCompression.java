    Modify quick-union (page 224) to include  path compression, by adding a loop to union() that links
    every site on the paths from  p and q to the roots of their trees to the root of the new tree.
    Give a sequence of input pairs that causes this method to produce a path of length 4.

    Note: The  amortized cost per operation for this algorithm is known to be logarithmic.

    Develop a performance-testing client that takes an int value T from the command line and performs T trials
    of the following experiment: Use your client from Exercise 1.5.17 to generate random connections, using
    UnionFind to determine connectivity as in our development client, looping until all sites are connected.
    For each N, print the value of N, the average number of connections  processed, and the ratio of the running time
    to the previous. Use your program to validate the hypotheses in the text that the running times for quick-find
    and quick-union are quadratic and weighted quick-union is near-linear.

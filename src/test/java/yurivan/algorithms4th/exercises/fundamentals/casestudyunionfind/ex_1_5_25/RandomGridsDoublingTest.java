    Develop a performance-testing client that takes
    an int value T from the command line and performs T trials of the following experiment:
    Use your client from Exercise 1.5.18 to generate the connections in an N-by-N  square grid,
    randomly oriented and in random order, then use UnionFind to determine connectivity as in our development client,
    looping until all sites are connected. For each N, print the value of N, the average number of connections
    processed, and the ratio of the running time to the previous. Use your program to validate the hypotheses in the
    text that the running times for quick-Ô¨Ånd and quick-union are quadratic and weighted
    quick-union is near-linear.

    Note: As N doubles, the number of sites in the grid increases by a factor of 4, so expect a doubling factor of 16
    for quadratic and 4 for linear.

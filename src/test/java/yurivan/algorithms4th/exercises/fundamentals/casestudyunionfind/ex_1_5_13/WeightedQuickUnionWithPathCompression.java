    Modify  weighted  quick-union (Algorithm 1.5) to implement path compression, as described in Exercise 1.5.12.
    Give a sequence of input pairs that causes this method to produce a tree of height 4.

    Note: The amortized cost per operation for this algorithm is known to be bounded by a function known as
    the inverse Ackermann function and is less than 5 for any conceivable practical value of N.

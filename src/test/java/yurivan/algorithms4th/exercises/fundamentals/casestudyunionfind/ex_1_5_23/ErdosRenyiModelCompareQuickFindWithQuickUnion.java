    Develop a performance-testing client that takes an int value T from the command line and performs
    T trials of the following experiment: Use your client from Exercise 1.5.17 to generate
    random connections. Save the connections, so that you can use both quick-union and
    quick-find to determine connectivity as in our development client, looping until all
    sites are connected. For each N, print the value of N and the ratio of the two running times.

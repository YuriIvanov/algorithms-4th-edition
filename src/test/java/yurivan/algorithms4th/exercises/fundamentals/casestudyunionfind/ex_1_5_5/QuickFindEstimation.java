    Estimate the minimum amount of time (in days) that would be required for quick-find to solve a dynamic connectivity
    problem with 10 pow 9 sites and 10 pow 6 input pairs, on a computer capable of executing
    10 pow 9 instructions per second. Assume that each iteration of the inner for loop requires 10 machine instructions.

/*
    Develop a UF client ErdosRenyi that takes an integer  value N from the command line, generates
    random pairs of integers between 0 and N-1, calling connected() to determine if they are connected
    and then union() if not (as in our development client), looping until all sites are connected,
    and printing the number of connections generated. Package your program as a static method count() that takes
    N as argument and returns the number of connections and a main() that takes N from
    the command line, calls count(), and prints the returned value.
